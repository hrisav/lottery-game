# lottery-game

We were going to organize a football tournament in my local area. Before bidding for the players, that we had to randomly distribute 4 captains to 4 managers. Due to lockdown, the event was held online. Friends were sceptic how a lottery could be held online. So I came up with this code which allocated 4 captains randomly to 4 teams/managers.
